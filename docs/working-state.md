# Working state

Checkpoint as of 2026-10-10. This page holds temporary context: what is in
flight, the latest check results and the next actions. Rewrite it at the end of
each session and when a pull request opens or merges. Anything that will still
be true next month belongs in [context/](context/) or
[open-items.md](open-items.md), as the [docs index](README.md) explains.

## Current objective

Finish Stage 5, breadth, the last planned stage. All 13 tasks of the
[Stage 5 plan](superpowers/plans/2026-10-09-quarry-stage5-breadth.md) are
committed on `claude/quarry-stage5-breadth`, and so are the fixes from the
whole-branch review; the pull request against `main` comes next.

### Stage 1: core

Done. What it left is filed in [open-items.md](open-items.md).

### Stage 2: server and agent

Merged to `main` in sunpar/quarry#2 as `7779c05` on 2026-10-09. Its calls are
under [server and agent](context/decisions.md#server-and-agent), and what it
left is in [open-items.md](open-items.md). Neither provider adapter has called
its real API yet; see the [open questions](open-items.md#open-questions). The
fixes for five Codex reviews landed with it, as did the Stage 2 deferred items,
in seven reviewed tasks: config hardening, unreadable data paths, the
`RLIMIT_DATA` and thread caps, kernel client failures, metadata caching, restart
that stops a running step, and private session files with `origin_step`.

### Stage 3: first UI

Built on `claude/quarry-stage3-first-ui`, branched from the Stage 2 branch and
brought up to date with `main` after Stage 2 merged. All 12 plan tasks passed
their task reviews, the whole-branch review's fixes are in, and the Playwright
tests pass against the built UI. Its calls are under
[first UI](context/decisions.md#first-ui), the modules are in the
[code map](context/code-map.md#web), and what it left is filed in
[open-items.md](open-items.md). The maintainer approved the one security change,
the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header on the static mount. Merged to `main`
in sunpar/quarry#4 as `faf913f` on 2026-10-09 after a clean Codex review of its
fifth fix round.

### Stage 4: projects and canvas

Built on `claude/quarry-stage4-projects`, branched from `main` at `faf913f` and
brought up to date with `main`'s Stage 5 docs. All 12 plan tasks passed their
task reviews, and the Playwright test for save, recall and the canvas passes
against the built UI. Its calls are under
[projects](context/decisions.md#projects), with a few under
[server and agent](context/decisions.md#server-and-agent) and
[first UI](context/decisions.md#first-ui); the modules are in the
[code map](context/code-map.md#quarryprojects), and what it left is filed in
[open-items.md](open-items.md). The final review's four Important findings and
eight of its ten Minor ones are fixed; the other two, with the task reviews'
deferred findings a researcher could hit, are filed there too. A `/simplify`
pass then reused existing helpers and dropped the rail's per-project fetches.
Two `@claude` reviews on the pull request led to a lock around `project.json`
updates and to `child`, which keeps request names inside their directories.
Codex was out of review credits, so at the maintainer's call a whole-PR
`@claude` review stood in for it; it came back clean, and the pull request
merged on 2026-10-09.

### Stage 5: breadth

Built on `claude/quarry-stage5-breadth`, branched from the Stage 4 branch and
brought up to date with `main` once Stage 4 merged, as one pull request. Tasks 1
to 12 passed their task reviews, and Task 13 added the browser tests for "To
code", the library and the new chart libraries, the CI pins, `mypy` on the tests
and these docs. Its calls are under [views](context/decisions.md#views) and in
the other sections the plan touched, the modules are in the
[code map](context/code-map.md), and what it closed is gone from
[open-items.md](open-items.md). What it deferred is under
[Any time](open-items.md#any-time), and the task reviews' findings left for the
final review are [known problems](open-items.md#known-problems).

## Latest verification

`claude/quarry-stage5-breadth` after the final review's fixes, locally on
2026-10-10: `pytest` passed 1060 tests and skipped 3 (the live provider and
memory-cap tests), including the 10 browser tests under `tests/e2e`.
`ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `mypy src tests` and `uv lock --check` were
clean, and in `web/` `npm run check`, `npm test` (233 tests) and `npm run build`
passed. CI has not run on the branch, since no pull request is open.

## Next actions

1. Open the Stage 5 pull request against `main`, turn on CI Auto-fix, and review
   until it is clean and CI is green.

## Resuming

1. Read this page, then the [docs index](README.md) for where everything else
   lives.
2. Compare `git log --oneline -5 origin/main` and `gh pr list` with the tables
   above. When they disagree, trust git and fix this page.
